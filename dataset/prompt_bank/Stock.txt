Stock price dataset comprises daily measurements collected from a major publicly traded company over a three-year period, from January 2016 to January 2019. Each data point now includes six values: a timestamp (date), the opening price, the highest price, the lowest price, the closing price, and the trading volume. These values together provide insight into the companyâ€™s daily market performance, reflecting fluctuations in share price and investor activity throughout this time frame.
